# Mac-OS-X-iON-Live-Stream
Simple live stream OS X cocoa application for iON wifi-enabled camera

I used this because I wanted a full screen live stream from my iON wifi camera. The web interface is a little wonky so I looked at the JavaScript and replicated the frame requests in Swift. Feel free to submit a pull request to add a feature or fix bugs such as many threads being created if the camera's ip cannot be found, etc.
